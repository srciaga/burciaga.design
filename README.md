[srciaga.github.io](https://srciaga.github.io/) (aka burciaga.design) is my graphic design portfolio.

The site is compiled with [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) and the final build is automated with the [Hugo Setup action](https://github.com/marketplace/actions/hugo-setup).

## Updating

Pages can be added with `hugo new content {category}/{title}.md`.

View the site with `hugo server`.

To publish, push changes. Deployment is handled by the Hugo Setup action.
