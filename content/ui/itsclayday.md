[Its.Clay.Day](https://www.instagram.com/its.clay.day/) is a makeshift ceramics studio located in Northern California. The artist's Korean heritage and love of nature come together to create one-of-a-kind, small-batch ceramic objects for everyday use. Along with two of my peers, we conducted research and created a responsive website. My primary responsibilities included designing the visual elements and coding the frontend. Our goal was to design a website that would captivate customers and keep them coming back for more; with an emphasis on showcasing the beautiful and unique ceramic objects.
