Bookmatch is an app that helps readers find their next favorite book. Whether you're into thrillers, romance, or sci-fi, Bookmatch is here to guide you towards your next favorite read. By conducting user research and creating an interactive prototype, I was able to design an app that not only satisfies your reading preferences but also allows you to interact with fellow book enthusiasts.

The [prototype](https://www.figma.com/proto/9UpS75l47EkYGNcQ42NAhK/Bookmatch?page-id=0%3A1&node-id=49%3A138&viewport=608%2C232%2C0.25&scaling=scale-down) is available below. Tap, drag, and scroll to explore the app.
