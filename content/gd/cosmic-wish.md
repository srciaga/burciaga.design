Cosmic Wish is a space-themed character brand meant to capture the imaginations of 5-10 year old girls. The goal was to design characters, products, and an online storefront that would appeal to this demographic. With a focus on whimsy and fun, I created a vibrant, pastel-colored world filled with cute and lovable characters that kids will instantly connect with.
