[Eden Area ROP](https://www.edenrop.org/) offers career preparation courses to high school students in the Castro Valley, Hayward, San Leandro, and San Lorenzo school districts. Students in the Graphics class are given the opportunity to design ROP's annual course catalog. My design was selected and used as the cover for the 2018-19 catalog.
