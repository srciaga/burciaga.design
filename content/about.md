Hi, I'm Stephanie Burciaga! I'm a designer from the Bay Area with a passion for creating simple and friendly experiences. I'm always up for new challenges and chances to pick up new skills.

When I'm not designing, I'm:

- Waiting for Hanya Yanagihara's next novel...
- Watching offbeat movies...
- And learning how to code. (I built this website!)

Let's make something together! If you're interested, please [get in touch](/contact.html).
