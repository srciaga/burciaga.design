The logos presented here are for Chabot&rsquo;s Communication Lab, Performing Arts Complex, and Anthropology Department. While only one of my designs was selected for official use, all three demonstrate my ability to meet the unique needs of each client.</p><h2 id=performing-arts-complex>Performing Arts Complex</h2><p>The Chabot Performing Arts Complex (PAC) requested a new logo that would help reposition the venue as an independent destination for events. The client wanted a design that conveyed the message that the PAC is more than just a college theater, and can cater to a wide range of events. It was requested that we steer clear of traditional theater imagery such as the classic comedy and tragedy masks, and instead focus on showcasing the PAC as a versatile and multi-purpose venue.</p><p>Keywords: innovative, adaptable, professional</p><figure><img src=https://via.placeholder.com/1100x500 alt=FIXME><figcaption><p>Brainstorming.</p></figcaption></figure><figure><img src=https://via.placeholder.com/1100x500 alt=FIXME><figcaption><p>Final designs selected by the client.</p></figcaption></figure><h2 id=communication-lab>Communication Lab</h2><p>The Communication Lab requested a logo that would convey a warm and welcoming tone while emphasizing the importance of human interaction.
